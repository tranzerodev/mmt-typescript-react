To use the Platform, you must first create an account (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;) through the Service by visiting this </span><span class="c0">link (</span><span>https://app.lightout.com/?action=signup</span><span class="c0">).

Once you select an Experience, you will be able to customize the Experience in several ways (subject to restrictions applicable to each individual Experience), including but not limited to uploading your Content</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and selecting the level of hours (the &ldquo;Hours&rdquo;) you want to use to advertise your Content</span><span>. </span><span class="c0">Additionally, each Experience will provide a summary of the fees charged for advertising your Content through the Experience. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You may also view your Experiences on the Buyer dashboard (the &ldquo;Dashboard&rdquo;).
